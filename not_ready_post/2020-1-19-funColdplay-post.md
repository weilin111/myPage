I know it's over before she says
她未开口，我便已知晓结局


I know the falls that the water face
爱意沉入水底，消失殆尽


I know it's over
一切都画上句点


An ocean awaits for a storm
如静候风暴来临的海面


The sun on snow
日出瓦解千堆雪


Rivers in rain
雨滴消失于水面


Crystal ball can foresee a change
水晶球预知着命运变迁


And I know it's over, a parting of ways
我知道都结束了，只好就此分别


And it's done
一切尘埃落定


But didn't we have fun?
可难道，我们不曾欢愉？


Don't say it was all a waste
别说一切皆为虚度


Didn't we have fun?
难道曾经只有痛苦？


Oh-oooh-ooh

From the top of the world
到达过极乐


Top of the waves
也风雨同舟


We said forever, forever always
曾许诺永远，即便沧海桑田


We could have been lost
我们也曾迷失方向


We would have been saved
也终会得到救赎


Oh, I

Now we're stopping the world
此刻我们的世界停止运转


Stopping its spin
停滞不前


But, come on, don't give up
可是，别就此放弃


Don't say we give in
别说无能为力


Don't say it's over
别说尘埃落定


Don't say we're done
别说就此告别


Oh, didn't we have fun?
难道我们不曾欢愉？

Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh, didn't we have fun?
难道曾经皆为苦涩？


I know it's over before she says
她开口前就已经画上句点


Know someone else has taken your place
时过境迁，早已物是人非


"I know it's over."
“一切都结束了”


Icarus says to the Sun
伊卡洛斯从空中坠落


The sword sinks in, lightning strikes
圣剑沉入海底，电闪雷鸣


And two force, two forces collide
两种力量，相互撕扯


And fight til it's over
直至无力回天


Fight til it's done
直至结局浮现


Ah-ah-ah

But didn't we have fun?
难道我们不曾欢愉？


Don't say it was all a waste
别说一切皆为虚度


Didn't we have fun?
难道我们只有苦涩？


Oh-oooh-ooh

From the top of the world
同甘


Top of the waves
共苦


We said forever, forever always
曾许诺永远，即便沧海桑田


We could have been lost
我们曾迷失方向


We would have been saved
也终将得到救赎


Oh, I


Now we're stopping the world
现如今我们的世界停止运转


Stopped it in its tracks
停滞不前


But nothing's too broken to find a way back
可也并非覆水难收


So before it's over
在一切结束之前


Before you run
在你离去之前


Ah, didn't we have fun?
难道我们只有痛苦？


'Cause you and me
只因你我二人


We were always meant to
早已是命中注定


Always meant to be
命中注定


We were always meant to
早已是命中注定


Always meant to
命中注定


You and me
你与我


We were always meant to
本就该厮守终生


Always meant to be
厮守终生


Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, didn't we have fun?
难道我们不曾欢愉？


Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, didn't we have fun?
难道我们不曾欢愉？
 

But then, maybe we could again
或许，我们还能从头再来
